# Penguado Gateway

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Penguado Redirect App**, the future home of the upgraded **Penguado** site.

---

## 🌐 Live Sites

- **Original Site:** [Google Sites Version](https://sites.google.com/westfordk12.us/a-penguado-lll-bms/) *(Link active until June 2029)*  
- **New Site (In Progress):** [penguado.top](https://penguado.top) *(Hosted via GitHub Pages)*

---

## About This Project

This repository hosts all assets and source code for transitioning **Penguado** from its original Google Sites version to a modern, faster, and fully-featured site hosted via GitHub Pages.

### Why the Migration?

- **Performance**: Google Sites is slow and limited.
- **Flexibility**: GitHub Pages enables full customization and better responsiveness.
- **Maintenance**: The GitHub Pages version will receive regular updates. Google Sites will be minimally maintained.
- **Monetization**: penguado.top will be monetized by the end of **2025**.
